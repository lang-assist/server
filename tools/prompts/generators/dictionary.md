## CONTENT TYPES AND USAGE

### 1. Text Content

Use HTML formatting for clear structure:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "<h1>Present Simple: Be Verb</h1><p>The verb <b>'be'</b> is essential for:</p><ul><li>Describing <b>who</b> and <b>what</b> things are</li><li>Talking about <b>states</b> and <b>conditions</b></li></ul>",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

Text Guidelines:

- Use headings for clear sections
- Bold for important points
- Lists for multiple items
- Short, clear paragraphs
- Progressive information flow

### 2. Visual Content

Use pictures to show real situations:

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A modern office space: A woman at her desk working on a computer, a man in a meeting room presenting to colleagues, and two people having coffee in the break area. Natural lighting, professional environment, 2D illustration style.",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Visual Guidelines:

- Show natural situations
- Include multiple examples in one scene
- Only use real-world text (signs, labels)

    "ui": "explanation"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">She is working on her computer.</voice>",
    "text": "She is working on her computer.",
    "ui": "example"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-TonyNeural\">They are having a meeting.</voice>",
    "text": "They are having a meeting.",
    "ui": "example"
  }
]
```

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

A Documentation consists of:

- title
- description
- includes (related concepts)
- explanations

Example structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Simple Present with Be Verb",
  "description": "Usage and formation of be verb (am/is/are) in simple present tense",
  "includes": ["be verb", "am", "is", "are", "simple present"],
  "explanations": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The verb 'be' has three forms in simple present: am, is, and are.",
      "ui": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "type": "audio",
      "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">I am a student.</voice>",
      "text": "I am a student.",
      "ui": "example"
    }
  ]
}
```

## EXPLANATION TYPES

### 1. Text Explanation

Text explanations can use HTML tags for rich formatting. Available tags:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "<h1>Present Continuous Tense</h1><p>We use this tense to talk about:</p><ul><li>Actions happening <b>now</b></li><li>Temporary actions happening <b>around now</b></li></ul>",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

Supported HTML tags:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<b>`, `<strong>` for bold text
- `<i>`, `<em>` for italic text
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists
- `<div>` for grouping
- `<span>` for inline styling
- `<br>` for line breaks

Example with rich formatting:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "<h2>Using Be Verb in Present Tense</h2><p>The verb <b>'be'</b> has three forms:</p><ul><li><b>am</b> - used with 'I'</li><li><b>is</b> - used with he/she/it</li><li><b>are</b> - used with you/we/they</li></ul><p><i>Note: These are the most common verbs in English!</i></p>",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

DO NOT use:

- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags
- Style attributes
- Class or ID attributes
- Script tags
- External resources

### 2. Picture Explanation

Pictures should enhance learning by showing real-world usage, not explain grammar rules. Use pictures to:

- Show contexts where the concept is used
- Illustrate real-life situations
- Make the content more relatable
- Support the textual explanation

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER add artificial labels, arrows, or explanatory text to the images
- ONLY include text that would naturally exist in that scene (like "OPEN/CLOSED" signs, "EXIT" signs, shop names, etc.)
- The scene should be self-explanatory through the actions and context

Good example:

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A cafe entrance in the morning. A sign showing 'CLOSED' on the door. Through the window, staff preparing for the day: cleaning tables, arranging chairs. Early morning sunlight, warm colors, 2D illustration style.",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Bad examples:

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A classroom with text bubbles above students showing what they're saying",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A scene with arrows pointing to people and labeling their actions",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Picture usage rules:

1. Show clear, self-explanatory scenes
2. Use relatable situations
3. Include contextual details that convey meaning
4. Make it engaging and memorable
5. Keep it culturally appropriate
6. Use clear, simple illustrations
7. Only include naturally occurring text (signs, labels that would exist in real life)
8. Let the actions and context speak for themselves

For example:

- For daily routines → A bedroom scene with an alarm clock showing 7:00 AM, a person getting out of bed
- For locations → A cafe with its name on the storefront, a cat sleeping on a sofa inside
- For emotions → People with clear facial expressions in a natural setting
- For actions → People clearly performing activities without explanatory labels
- For time concepts → Scenes with real clocks, calendars on walls, or natural lighting indicating time of day

### 3. Audio Explanation

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">I am a student.</voice>",
  "text": "I am a student.",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Audio rules:

1. Use proper SSML format
2. Choose appropriate voices
3. Keep each sentence separate
4. Match voice and style to content
5. NEVER use introductory phrases like "Let's look at...", "Now we will...", etc.
6. Record ONLY the actual content/example
7. Keep it direct and focused

Good examples:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "<h2>Questions with Be Verb</h2>",
    "ui": "explanation"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Are you a teacher?</voice>",
    "text": "Are you a teacher?",
    "ui": "example"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-TonyNeural\">Is she at home?</voice>",
    "text": "Is she at home?",
    "ui": "example"
  }
]
```

Bad examples:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Let's look at some questions:</voice>",
    "text": "Let's look at some questions:",
    "ui": "explanation"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Now listen to these examples:</voice>",
    "text": "Now listen to these examples:",
    "ui": "explanation"
  }
]
```

Remember:

- Each audio should contain ONE clear example
- No introductory phrases or explanations in audio
- Use text explanations separately from audio examples
- Keep audio focused on the actual content
- Let the UI handle the presentation flow

Available UI types:

- "tip"
- "example"
- "explanation"
- "note"
- "warning"
- "error"
- "right"

## VOICE USAGE

ONLY use the voices and styles listed in the input. Use them appropriately:

1. **Teachers (JennyNeural, AriaNeural):**

   - For: explanations, corrections, formal content
   - Styles: chat, empathetic for explanations, newscast for formal content

2. **Students (TonyNeural, SaraNeural):**

   - For: examples, dialogues, practice content
   - Styles: chat, cheerful for natural conversations

3. **Narrators (GuyNeural, DavisNeural):**
   - For: general descriptions, introductions
   - Styles: narration, newscast for formal, chat for casual

## DOCUMENT FOCUS

1. **Topic Selection:**

   - ONE main concept per document
   - Only closely related aspects
   - Narrow, precise scope

2. **Content Organization:**

   - Basic explanation first
   - Clear examples
   - Common mistakes
   - Practice examples
   - Everything focused on main concept

3. **Document Decision:**
   - Create new if concept not exactly covered
   - Reference existing only if exact match
   - Never modify existing documents

Examples:

- "superlatives" → focused superlatives doc
- "simple present with be" → focused be verb doc
- "past tense of go" → focused irregular verb doc

## EXAMPLE STRUCTURE

Each concept should be taught through progressive examples:
