# Picture Prompt Guidelines

When creating picture prompts, follow these guidelines to ensure consistent and high-quality picture generation:

## General Rules

Always write prompts in English. Be specific and descriptive. Keep prompts between 10-50 words. Focus on visual elements only. Avoid abstract concepts.

## CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS

- NEVER include ANY text elements in images - text generation is unreliable and often incorrect
- NEVER include clocks, watches, digital displays, or any time-showing devices
- NEVER include numbers, dates, or any numerical information
- NEVER include signs, labels, or written information of any kind
- NEVER create images that directly reveal answers to associated questions

These elements consistently fail to render correctly and often create misleading or incorrect visual information.

## Structure

Main Subject: Describe the primary subject first. Include age, gender if relevant. Specify important physical characteristics.

Environment/Setting: Describe the location/background. Mention time of day if relevant (but don't show clocks). Include weather conditions if outdoors.

Actions/Poses: Describe what subjects are doing. Specify facial expressions. Include body language.

Details: Include distinguishing features. Add contextually relevant elements. Describe important visual attributes. Consider scene-specific details.

## Examples

GOOD

"A young woman with long brown hair wearing a blue business suit is presenting to colleagues in a modern office meeting room. She's standing confidently by a whiteboard, gesturing with her hand."

"A busy street market at sunset with colorful fruit stalls. Vendors are arranging fresh produce while customers browse the displays."

"A cozy cafe interior with wooden tables and warm lighting. A barista in an apron is preparing coffee at a modern espresso machine."

"A traditional classroom with rows of desks. A teacher in professional attire is pointing to a simple world map on the wall."

"A bedroom in early morning with sunlight streaming through curtains. A person stretching after just waking up." (Instead of showing a clock with time)

BAD

"A woman who is nervous about her presentation and hopes to impress her boss is thinking about her career prospects while presenting."

"A restaurant with its menu written on the walls and special dishes listed on chalkboards." // Avoid ANY text elements

"A student reading a book with visible paragraphs of text on the pages." // Text won't be legible

"A modern office with motivational quotes and company values displayed on the walls." // Text won't render well

"A bedroom with an alarm clock showing 7:00 AM on the nightstand." // Time displays render incorrectly

"A classroom with a calendar showing March 15th on the wall." // Dates and numbers render incorrectly

"A kitchen with a recipe card showing ingredients and measurements." // Text and numbers render incorrectly

## Restrictions

NEVER include:

- Emotions or thoughts
- Future or past events
- Abstract concepts
- Non-visual elements
- Subjective judgments
- ANY text or writing of any kind
- Clocks, watches, or time displays
- Numbers, dates, or numerical information
- Signs, labels, or written information

AVOID:

- Brand names
- Copyrighted characters
- Complex artistic styles
- Technical camera terms
- Anything that would directly reveal an answer to an associated question

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of showing time with clocks:

- "A bedroom with early morning sunlight" (instead of "A bedroom with a clock showing 7:00 AM")
- "A busy restaurant during dinner time" (instead of "A restaurant at 8:00 PM")

Instead of showing text:

- "A classroom with educational posters" (instead of "A classroom with vocabulary words on the wall")
- "A store with colorful product displays" (instead of "A store with price tags and labels")
