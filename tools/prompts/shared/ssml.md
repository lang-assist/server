# SSML Documentation

We use microsoft azure as TTS service. Azure has some rules:

the root element `<speak>` and xml:lang attr and xml namespaces are CANNOT be included in your ssml content. Your ssml content will be wrapped with <speak> tag and attributes and namespaces will be added after your generation.

SO, YOU SHOULD ADD SSML LIKE:

```xml
<voice name="<voice name>">
    This is the text that is spoken.
</voice>
```

## Voice Name

Voice name is the name of the voice in the azure tts service.

All available voices and styles will be provided to you, except for the ones that are not allowed to be used. The following examples are only for reference.

example:

```xml
<voice name="en-US-AvaNeural">
    This is the text that is spoken.
</voice>
```
