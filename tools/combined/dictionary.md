## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

A Documentation consists of:

- title
- description
- includes (related concepts)
- explanations

Example structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Simple Present with Be Verb",
  "description": "Usage and formation of be verb (am/is/are) in simple present tense",
  "includes": ["be verb", "am", "is", "are", "simple present"],
  "explanations": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The verb 'be' has three forms in simple present: am, is, and are.",
      "ui": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "type": "audio",
      "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">I am a student.</voice>",
      "text": "I am a student.",
      "ui": "example"
    }
  ]
}
```

## EXPLANATION TYPES

### 1. Text Explanation

Text explanations can use HTML tags for rich formatting. Available tags:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "<h1>Present Continuous Tense</h1><p>We use this tense to talk about:</p><ul><li>Actions happening <b>now</b></li><li>Temporary actions happening <b>around now</b></li></ul>",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

Supported HTML tags:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<b>`, `<strong>` for bold text
- `<i>`, `<em>` for italic text
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists
- `<div>` for grouping
- `<span>` for inline styling
- `<br>` for line breaks

Example with rich formatting:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "<h2>Using Be Verb in Present Tense</h2><p>The verb <b>'be'</b> has three forms:</p><ul><li><b>am</b> - used with 'I'</li><li><b>is</b> - used with he/she/it</li><li><b>are</b> - used with you/we/they</li></ul><p><i>Note: These are the most common verbs in English!</i></p>",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

DO NOT use:

- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags
- Style attributes
- Class or ID attributes
- Script tags
- External resources

### 2. Picture Explanation

Pictures should enhance learning by showing real-world usage, not explain grammar rules. Use pictures to:

- Show contexts where the concept is used
- Illustrate real-life situations
- Make the content more relatable
- Support the textual explanation

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER add artificial labels, arrows, or explanatory text to the images
- ONLY include text that would naturally exist in that scene (like "OPEN/CLOSED" signs, "EXIT" signs, shop names, etc.)
- The scene should be self-explanatory through the actions and context

Good example:

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A cafe entrance in the morning. A sign showing 'CLOSED' on the door. Through the window, staff preparing for the day: cleaning tables, arranging chairs. Early morning sunlight, warm colors, 2D illustration style.",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Bad examples:

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A classroom with text bubbles above students showing what they're saying",
  "ui": "explanation"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "picture",
  "picturePrompt": "A scene with arrows pointing to people and labeling their actions",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Picture usage rules:

1. Show clear, self-explanatory scenes
2. Use relatable situations
3. Include contextual details that convey meaning
4. Make it engaging and memorable
5. Keep it culturally appropriate
6. Use clear, simple illustrations
7. Only include naturally occurring text (signs, labels that would exist in real life)
8. Let the actions and context speak for themselves

For example:

- For daily routines → A bedroom scene with an alarm clock showing 7:00 AM, a person getting out of bed
- For locations → A cafe with its name on the storefront, a cat sleeping on a sofa inside
- For emotions → People with clear facial expressions in a natural setting
- For actions → People clearly performing activities without explanatory labels
- For time concepts → Scenes with real clocks, calendars on walls, or natural lighting indicating time of day

### 3. Audio Explanation

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">I am a student.</voice>",
  "text": "I am a student.",
  "ui": "example"
}
```

Audio rules:

1. Use proper SSML format
2. Choose appropriate voices
3. Keep each sentence separate
4. Match voice and style to content
5. NEVER use introductory phrases like "Let's look at...", "Now we will...", etc.
6. Record ONLY the actual content/example
7. Keep it direct and focused

Good examples:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "<h2>Questions with Be Verb</h2>",
    "ui": "explanation"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Are you a teacher?</voice>",
    "text": "Are you a teacher?",
    "ui": "example"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-TonyNeural\">Is she at home?</voice>",
    "text": "Is she at home?",
    "ui": "example"
  }
]
```

Bad examples:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Let's look at some questions:</voice>",
    "text": "Let's look at some questions:",
    "ui": "explanation"
  },
  {
    "type": "audio",
    "ssml": "<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">Now listen to these examples:</voice>",
    "text": "Now listen to these examples:",
    "ui": "explanation"
  }
]
```

Remember:

- Each audio should contain ONE clear example
- No introductory phrases or explanations in audio
- Use text explanations separately from audio examples
- Keep audio focused on the actual content
- Let the UI handle the presentation flow

Available UI types:

- "tip"
- "example"
- "explanation"
- "note"
- "warning"
- "error"
- "right"

## VOICE USAGE

ONLY use the voices and styles listed in the input. Use them appropriately:

1. **Teachers (JennyNeural, AriaNeural):**

   - For: explanations, corrections, formal content
   - Styles: chat, empathetic for explanations, newscast for formal content

2. **Students (TonyNeural, SaraNeural):**

   - For: examples, dialogues, practice content
   - Styles: chat, cheerful for natural conversations

3. **Narrators (GuyNeural, DavisNeural):**

# Picture Prompt Guidelines

When creating picture prompts, follow these guidelines to ensure consistent and high-quality picture generation:

## General Rules

Always write prompts in English. Be specific and descriptive. Keep prompts between 10-50 words. Focus on visual elements only. Avoid abstract concepts.

## CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS

- NEVER include ANY text elements in images - text generation is unreliable and often incorrect
- NEVER include clocks, watches, digital displays, or any time-showing devices
- NEVER include numbers, dates, or any numerical information
- NEVER include signs, labels, or written information of any kind
- NEVER create images that directly reveal answers to associated questions

These elements consistently fail to render correctly and often create misleading or incorrect visual information.

## Structure

Main Subject: Describe the primary subject first. Include age, gender if relevant. Specify important physical characteristics.

Environment/Setting: Describe the location/background. Mention time of day if relevant (but don't show clocks). Include weather conditions if outdoors.

Actions/Poses: Describe what subjects are doing. Specify facial expressions. Include body language.

Details: Include distinguishing features. Add contextually relevant elements. Describe important visual attributes. Consider scene-specific details.

## Examples

GOOD

"A young woman with long brown hair wearing a blue business suit is presenting to colleagues in a modern office meeting room. She's standing confidently by a whiteboard, gesturing with her hand."

"A busy street market at sunset with colorful fruit stalls. Vendors are arranging fresh produce while customers browse the displays."

"A cozy cafe interior with wooden tables and warm lighting. A barista in an apron is preparing coffee at a modern espresso machine."

"A traditional classroom with rows of desks. A teacher in professional attire is pointing to a simple world map on the wall."

"A bedroom in early morning with sunlight streaming through curtains. A person stretching after just waking up." (Instead of showing a clock with time)

BAD

"A woman who is nervous about her presentation and hopes to impress her boss is thinking about her career prospects while presenting."

"A restaurant with its menu written on the walls and special dishes listed on chalkboards." // Avoid ANY text elements

"A student reading a book with visible paragraphs of text on the pages." // Text won't be legible

"A modern office with motivational quotes and company values displayed on the walls." // Text won't render well

"A bedroom with an alarm clock showing 7:00 AM on the nightstand." // Time displays render incorrectly

"A classroom with a calendar showing March 15th on the wall." // Dates and numbers render incorrectly

"A kitchen with a recipe card showing ingredients and measurements." // Text and numbers render incorrectly

## Restrictions

NEVER include:

- Emotions or thoughts
- Future or past events
- Abstract concepts
- Non-visual elements
- Subjective judgments
- ANY text or writing of any kind
- Clocks, watches, or time displays
- Numbers, dates, or numerical information
- Signs, labels, or written information

AVOID:

- Brand names
- Copyrighted characters
- Complex artistic styles
- Technical camera terms
- Anything that would directly reveal an answer to an associated question

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of showing time with clocks:

- "A bedroom with early morning sunlight" (instead of "A bedroom with a clock showing 7:00 AM")
- "A busy restaurant during dinner time" (instead of "A restaurant at 8:00 PM")

Instead of showing text:

- "A classroom with educational posters" (instead of "A classroom with vocabulary words on the wall")
- "A store with colorful product displays" (instead of "A store with price tags and labels")
