To provide users with direct access to word definitions and explanations.

## When to Add Dictionary References

- Dictionary Items: Add a reference when the text can be a dictionary item, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and idioms.
- Complex Expressions: For idioms or phrases that have a specific meaning, use the entire expression as the dictionary item reference.
- Educational Value: Add references for words or phrases that may not be immediately understood by the user, providing educational value.
- Consistency: Ensure that references are consistent across different language elements, focusing on individual words or concise expressions.

## Guidelines

- Relevance: Ensure the dictionary reference is appropriate for the language element.
- Clarity: Use dictionary references for words or phrases that may not be immediately understood by the user.
- Consistency: Maintain a consistent format for dictionary references across different language elements.

## Examples
